# Hi, I'm Bharanidharan Hemachandran 👋

### Principal Technical Consultant | Enterprise Application Architect | Startup Founder

I am a systems thinker and hands-on architect with over 15 years of experience building, scaling, and modernizing mission-critical enterprise software. Currently, I operate as the Founder of **Conseil Bodhi Inc.** and the CTO/Co-Founder of **Beacon Pilot**, where I focus on bridging the gap between legacy infrastructure and applied Generative AI. 

I specialize in untangling complex monolithic applications, designing event-driven cloud microservices, and deploying secure, multi-modal AI pipelines for enterprise environments.

### 🏗️ What I Build & Architect

* **Legacy-to-Cloud Modernization:** Refactoring heavy, tightly coupled monoliths (like desktop MATLAB or legacy C#) into highly scalable, event-driven microservices using AWS serverless compute and distributed message brokers (Apache Pulsar, SQS).
* **High-Throughput Data Pipelines:** Architecting distributed, rate-limited ingestion engines capable of processing tens of millions of entities with sub-second hybrid search latency (OpenSearch/Elasticsearch + Sharded MongoDB).
* **Secure Enterprise AI:** Deploying air-gapped, local LLMs (Ollama) and multi-modal Agentic workflows that process highly sensitive IP and telemetry without exposing data to public APIs.
* **Decoupled Front-Ends:** Building high-speed, edge-delivered Single Page Applications (Next.js, React) to serve complex backend analytics cleanly to the end user.

### 💻 Core Technology Stack

* **Architecture:** Event-Driven Microservices, Cloud-Native (AWS), Domain-Driven Design, Zero-Trust VPCs.
* **Backend & Data:** Python (FastAPI), Node.js, PostgreSQL, MongoDB (Sharded Clusters), AWS OpenSearch, Redis.
* **Applied AI:** LangChain, Local LLMs (Ollama), Vector Search, Prompt Engineering, Multi-Modal Inferencing.
* **Infrastructure & Ops:** Docker, CI/CD, Apache Pulsar, AWS (EC2, S3, Lambda, CloudFront).
